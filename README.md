# KnightCodeSkeleton

This project encapsulates the directory structure required for the final project in CS322. Additionally, it contains an ant build.xml file you can use to buid/compile/clean your project if you wish. Refer to the build.xml file for the build/clean targets.

The kcc compiler accepts to cmd line args, the first being the .kc file to compile, and the second being the name of the final output file to run.
It is assumed that both of these files are in subdirectories, the output going to an folder named output.
